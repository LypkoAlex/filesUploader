File uploader
------------------------------------------------------
### RUN

### Installation
```sh
$ npm install
$ npm start
```
in another terminal
```sh
$ node watcher.js -h localhost -p 3000
```
 get session-id from that and run script for uploading a file
```sh
$ node client.js -h localhost -f  /path/to/file -p 3000 -s <session-id>
```

Also you can make a lot of watchers and clients. For adding one more client you have to use -s param. like this
```sh
$ node watcher.js -h localhost -p 3000 -s <session-id>
```

If you will upload more than one file on one time it will be working :)
